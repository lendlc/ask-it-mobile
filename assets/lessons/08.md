# Lesson 8: While Loop

## Iteration Structure 2

Java `while` loop is used to run a specific code until a certain condition is met. It is used when the number of iterations is not known. In case of no condition, an error will be shown and initialization is repeated if carried out during the stage of checking. 

Sample code:

```
// Program to display numbers from 1 to 5

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // declare variables
    int i = 1, n = 5;

    // while loop from 1 to 5
    while(i <= n) {
      System.out.println(i);
      i++;
    }
  }
}
```
