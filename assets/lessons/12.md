# Lesson 12: Exception Handling
Java provides five keywords that are used to handle the exception. The following table describes each.

 - try - The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place an exception
code. It means we can't use try block alone. The try block must be followed by
either catch or finally.
 - catch - The "catch" block is used to handle the exception. It must be preceded by try
block which means we can't use catch block alone. It can be followed by finally
block later.
 - finally - The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. It is
executed whether an exception is handled or not.
 - throw - The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception.
 - throws - The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions. It specifies that there may
occur an exception in the method. It doesn't throw an exception. It is always used
with method signature.

### JavaExceptionExample.java
```java
public class JavaExceptionExample {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		try {
		//code that may raise exception
		
		int data=100/0;
		}catch (ArithmeticException e){System.out.println(e);}

		//rest code of the program

		System.out.println("rest of the code...");
	}
}
```
