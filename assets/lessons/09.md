# Lesson 9: do...while Loop

## Iteration Structure 3

The `do...while` loop is similar to while loop. However, the body of `do...while` loop is executed once before the test expression is checked.

Sample code:

```
// Java Program to display numbers from 1 to 5

import java.util.Scanner;

// Program to find the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 100.

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int i = 1, n = 5;

    // do...while loop from 1 to 5
    do {
      System.out.println(i);
      i++;
    } while(i <= n);
  }
}
```
