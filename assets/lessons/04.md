# Lesson 4: Sequential Structure

## The Basic Structure

This is the simplest of the three basic java control structure. Below is a sample code that illustrates this type of control structure.

    public class Age {
	    public static void main(String args[]){
	    int age;
	    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
	    System.out.println("Enter your age");
	    age = input.nextInt();
	    System.out.println("see you");
	    }
	} 

First, we created a class named age and prompted the user to enter their age.

We read the integer entered by the user and stored it in an integer variable named age.

We displayed on the console “see you”.

As you can see, from the programs output the various instructions in the code were sequentially executed. This same order will be followed if we were to run this same program for any number of time we want to run it.
