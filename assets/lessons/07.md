# Lesson 7: For-Loop

## Iteration Structure 1

_For-Loop_ is used when the number of iterations is known. In case of no condition, the loop is repeated infinite times.

Sample code:

```
// Program to print a text 5 times

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int n = 5;
    // for loop  
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      System.out.println("Java is fun");
    }
  }
}
```
    Output 
    Java is fun
    Java is fun
    Java is fun
    Java is fun
    Java is fun
